     TASK IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

This portfolio website is built using only HTML and CSS and is structured as a responsive, single-page layout. The main goal is to showcase a web developer’s profile, projects, and contact information in a visually appealing and accessible way.

The HTML file starts with a standard document structure. Inside the <head> tag, the metadata and a link to an external CSS file (style.css) are included. The <body> is divided into five main sections: header, hero, about, projects, and contact, followed by a footer.

1. Navigation and Header: The header uses a sticky top navigation bar to allow smooth access to sections through anchor tags like #about, #projects, etc. It is styled with a bold purple background and white text, using Flexbox for alignment.


2. Hero Section: This is the landing area that welcomes visitors. It includes a headline and a subtext with a bright blue gradient background, using center-aligned text. This section is the first visual impression and sets a modern and energetic tone for the site.


3. About Section: This section introduces the developer. It's concise and centered around highlighting web development skills. The heading uses a vibrant purple to stand out, and the text contrasts well against the white background.


4. Projects Section: A key part of any portfolio, this section includes a grid of project cards. Each card has a title and description, styled with padding, shadows, and a colored border for visual depth. The layout is responsive, meaning it adjusts based on screen size using CSS Grid and auto-fit.


5. Contact Section: The contact area provides placeholder email and GitHub links to simulate professional contact information. It's straightforward and easy to customize with real data later.


6. Footer: The footer completes the page with a copyright.



In terms of design, the site uses a colorful palette with gradients for visual impact. The combination of gradients, shadows, and borders provides a professional yet energetic vibe. Flexbox and Grid ensure the layout is responsive on both desktop and mobile.

The CSS uses base resets (* selector), semantic tags, and simple modern typography for readability. Elements like box-shadow, border-radius, and linear gradients help the website stand out without needing JavaScript or external libraries.

Overall, this code delivers a modern, colorful, and clean one-page portfolio that’s perfect for beginners or template reuse. It’s easy to modify for anyone wanting to add their own content or expand with advanced features later.
